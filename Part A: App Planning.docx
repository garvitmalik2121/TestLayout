CP3406 Assignment 1 Part A: App Planning

1. Scenario Selected: Scenario 6 – Student Study and Time Management App
An overview of the issue is that Lisa, a college student, balances her social life, part-time job, and coursework. She has trouble setting priorities, frequently misses deadlines, and has trouble efficiently managing her time. In order to maintain a healthy lifestyle, she needs a tool that may assist her in organizing, prioritizing, and monitoring her personal and academic obligations.

•	Why This Scenario is Meaningful:
Being a student myself, I completely understand Lisa's struggles. Students frequently struggle to balance their personal lives, careers, and education. It is pertinent and personally motivated to develop an app that fills this need because I would gain from utilizing such a solution.

•	Target Audience:
o	University and high school students
o	Part-time working students
o	Individuals preparing for exams or competitive tests
